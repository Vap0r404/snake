Hey there! Welcome to my first project on GitHub - a simple Snake game implemented in C++.
This project is my first attempt at game development, and I'm excited to share it with you.
If you're interested in game development or just want to contribute, feel free to fork this project, make improvements, or suggest new features. I'm open to feedback and collaboration!
